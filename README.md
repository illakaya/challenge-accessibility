# 01-challenge-accessibility

## Description

This project provided by the University of Sydney emulates an on-the-job ticket in which I refactor the existing code to make it more accessible. Increasing web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies like screen readers as well as rank higher in search engines. Editing the project allowed me to understand the needs of users with disabilities and how to make the site more accessible by testing using a screen reader. Through this project, I learnt to:

- Use semantic HTML elements to increase the accessibility of a site
- Structure HTML elements such that they follow a logical order
- Add `alt` attributes to `img` elements sos that screen readers can describe the image to vision impaired users
- Add a title so that users can easily navigate back to the site using the tab
- Consolidate and organize CSS to follow semantic structure
- Apply Scout Rule to leave the code cleaner than when I found it
